## Overview

`Layout` is a general-use layout component. Children are passed through this component.
This layout adds an error boundary around the main content in case any errors are thrown
in a page and unhandled.

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Layout} />

## Usage

Layout is not meant to be used outside of the `_app.tsx` file. This file is responsible
for setting up the root of the react tree.
